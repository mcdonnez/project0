After doing plenty of hiking near Provo, I decided there needed to be a website out there to document them all. Hiking is one of the best things to do in Provo. From the hours I've spent online I haven't found any good source for those that come to live in Provo for school or other reasons and want to know what's out there. This website covers all of the hikes I've found within driving distance of Provo.</p>
